# Fullscreen keyboard / phantom-navbar repro

A minimal, self-contained reproduction of a Chromium-on-Android bug that shows up in **fullscreen**
(entered via the Fullscreen API) when the top-level container is sized to the **dynamic viewport**
(`100dvh`). Installing as a PWA is **not** required.

## Symptom

When the on-screen keyboard is dismissed (especially with a quick tap), the OS navigation bar
flickers back in "phantom" — it isn't really drawn, but the browser briefly reports a viewport
shrunk *as if* it were there. The `100dvh` container faithfully shrinks with it, so a strip of the
**root canvas** (the page's default background) is exposed along the bottom edge. With a default
white canvas this reads as a bright white bar. Dismissing with a **long press** usually avoids it.

The underlying viewport update is **interaction-gated, not time-based**: `innerHeight`,
`visualViewport`, and `VirtualKeyboard.boundingRect` sit frozen at the stale value for as long as you
wait, then snap only on the next real touch. So no amount of waiting lets the page "catch up".

### `interactive-widget` mode matters

The magenta strip appears in **`resizes-visual`** and **`overlays-content`**, but **not** in
**`resizes-content`**. In `resizes-content` the keyboard resizes the layout viewport, so the `100dvh`
container is laid out against the actually-available area and never exposes the canvas; in the other
two the layout viewport stays "full" and the transient phantom-navbar shrink is what leaks the strip.

But `resizes-content` is not a clean escape either: the bottom bar at `bottom: 0` still sits about a
**navbar height too low**, so the keyboard overlaps it by that much. Same offset the phantom navbar
is responsible for — the resized layout viewport's bottom sits below the keyboard's top by the navbar
height. So the navbar-height error is present in *every* mode; only its outward form differs (canvas
strip vs. occluded input).

Two smaller, related quirks the HUD also exposes:

- In `VirtualKeyboard` overlay mode, `geometrychange` fires **one interaction late** — on open it
  still reports the closed geometry; the real height arrives at the next focus change (blur).
- `VirtualKeyboard.boundingRect.height` is measured from the layout-viewport bottom, so it **omits
  the navigation bar** — it is short by the navbar height versus the OS IME window.

## What's in the page

- A `<test-app>` **custom element** (shadow DOM) sized to `100dvh` with an opaque dark background —
  the app container. The **root canvas is painted magenta** so any uncovered strip is unmissable.
- A fixed bottom bar with a text input (the thing that must ride above the keyboard).
- A live **HUD** (top of screen) sampling every frame: `innerHeight`, `visualViewport`,
  `VirtualKeyboard.boundingRect`, `--kbtop`, display-mode, fullscreen element.
- Toggle buttons that show their current state and isolate variables:
  - **Fullscreen (API)** — enter/exit element-fullscreen (the trigger; no install needed).
  - **VK overlaysContent** — flip the VirtualKeyboard overlay mode.
  - **Container height 100dvh / 100lvh** — switch between the dynamic and the **large** viewport.
    On `100lvh` the container always covers the physical screen, so the magenta strip cannot appear —
    this is the "remove the hole" fix.
  - **Bar anchor bottom:0 / top (--kbtop)** — position the bar with `bottom: 0` vs
    `bottom: calc(100% - var(--kbtop))` (top-referenced, immune to the bottom drifting).
  - **iw** — set `interactive-widget` (`resizes-visual` / `resizes-content` / `overlays-content`).

## How to run

Serve over **HTTPS** or `http://localhost` (the Fullscreen API and VirtualKeyboard API need a secure
context), open on an Android phone in a Chromium browser, then:

```sh
# any static server works, e.g.:
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

1. Tap **Enter fullscreen (API)**.
2. Focus the input → keyboard opens.
3. Dismiss with a **short tap** on the card → watch for the magenta strip and the frozen HUD numbers.
4. Compare a **long-press** dismiss (usually clean).
5. Toggle **100lvh** and repeat — the strip should be gone.

## Environment where observed

- Android, Chromium-based browser, fullscreen, 3-button navigation bar.
